        HTTPS is crucial for secure internet browsing, encrypting data transmitted between your browser and websites. It protects sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers from interception by malicious actors. HTTPS also verifies the authenticity of websites, helping to prevent phishing attacks. Look for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar to confirm you're on a secure HTTPS connection.

      challenge: "What is the key benefit of HTTPS?
                  A. It improves the loading speed of a website.
                  B. It ensures that the website is visible in search engine results.
                  C. It encrypts data transmitted between the userâ€™s browser and the website, providing security and privacy.
                  D. It allows the website to use more images and videos."

        Fake websites often mimic legitimate ones to steal personal information or spread malware. Always check the URL carefully for misspellings or unusual domains. Be wary of sites with poor grammar, unprofessional design, or deals that seem too good to be true. When in doubt, access websites by typing the URL directly or using a trusted bookmark rather than clicking on links in emails or messages.

      challenge: "Select three red flags that might indicate a website is fake:
                  1. Invalid Certification
                  2. Poor Website Design/Layout
                  3. Social Media Presence
                  4. Unverified Reviews
                  5. Recognizable Payment Options"

                  A. 1, 2, 3
                  B. 3, 4, 5
                  C. 2, 4, 5
